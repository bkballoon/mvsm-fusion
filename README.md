# mvsm-fusion
TIPS:()

1. please run the main.py and dvfusion.py in the "image_saliency_fusion" folder. And the fusion parameter is mentioned in paper.
2. some results has been upload in demo if you want to see the results directly.
3. I upload some videos in demo folder to help understand.
4. The codes are unprocessed, so some unmeaning methods also be upload and they are hard to understand. I will reconstruct the codes when I'm free.
5. The OpenGL codes will be upload sooner.
6. Some data will continue to be uploaded with permission.
